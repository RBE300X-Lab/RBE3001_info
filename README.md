## Having Trouble With Your Robot

See [the troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/RBE300X-Lab/RBE3001_info/blob/main/troubleshooting.md)

## Calibration Procedure
1. Disable the motors using the switch
2. Move the robot to the calibrate position
3. Press and hold the `Home` button until the LED flashes.
4. Re-enable the motors

#### Do NOT just hold the `Home` button to reset the robot; it will force the robot to violently slam the table. Disable motors, then manually move the robot to the calibration pose.
